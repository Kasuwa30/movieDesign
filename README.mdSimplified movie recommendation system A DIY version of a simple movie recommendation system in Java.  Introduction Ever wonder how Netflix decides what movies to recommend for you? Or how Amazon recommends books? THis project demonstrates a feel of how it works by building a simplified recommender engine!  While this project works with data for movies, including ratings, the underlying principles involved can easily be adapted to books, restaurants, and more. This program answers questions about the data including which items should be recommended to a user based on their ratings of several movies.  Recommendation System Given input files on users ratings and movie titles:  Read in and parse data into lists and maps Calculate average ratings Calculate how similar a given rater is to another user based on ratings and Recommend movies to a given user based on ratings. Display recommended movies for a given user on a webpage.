**Movie Design: A DIY Guide to Creating a Simple Movie Display System with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
I just love **bold text**.
####Introduction
Have you ever wondered how websites like Netflix are designed? Their sleek color schemes, the ability to scroll through multiple movies in a single line, and the overall user experience are impressive.

This project aims not only to demonstrate the basic principles of building a movie website but also to explore how functionalities are implemented and how color schemes are integrated seamlessly.

Let's dive into the core components of building a simple movie display system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML: Structuring the Content
Start by creating the basic structure of the web page. This includes a container for the movie display and individual elements for each movie.
CSS: Styling the Movies
Next, apply some styling to the HTML structure to make it visually appealing. This includes setting the color scheme, layout, and hover effects.
JavaScript: Adding Interactivity
To add interactivity, such as horizontal scrolling, you can use JavaScript. For simplicity, let's add an event listener that allows users to scroll through the movies.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you've created a basic movie display system with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases fundamental techniques used in movie websites, focusing on how functionality works and how color schemes are integrated to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Feel free to expand on this project by adding more features such as dynamic movie loading, filtering, or integrating a movie database API for real-time data.
